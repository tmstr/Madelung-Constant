# calculation of madlung constant for NaCl crystal.
# madlung constant \alpha is given by \sum_{i,j,k} $\pm$\frac{1}{\sqrt{i^2+j^2+k^2}}
# negative sign is for (i+j+k) even where sodium lies and is positive sign for(i+j+k) is odd where chlorine lies
# we take the reference ion as chlorine ie negative ion at (0,0,0) position
# Using the convention of "Introduction to solid state physics" By Kittel Seventh edition 3.21 equation.
# Here we have taken advantage of crystal symmetry. So we are dealing only with first quadrant, x-axis and x-y plane
